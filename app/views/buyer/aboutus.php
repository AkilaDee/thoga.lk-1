            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>With the data obtained by a  survey done with the farmers, we have identified that the farmers are 
            very dissatisfied when they are dealing with the buyers in the economic centers. And while bringing the 
            harvest to the Economic center, there is a huge wastage due to inadequate transportation. With all these 
            factors we have came up with a solution Thogs.lk Which is a great platform for the farmers and wholesale 
            buyers enabling buyers to directly buy from the farmers without visiting Economic Center. Thoga.lk have 
            advanced features which ease the life of users. Delivery service is also available and buyers can find a 
            cheap driver from the registered drivers. </p>

            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p>
                The main goal of this system is to make a connection between buyers and farmers in order
                to reduce their transport costs and give farmers a better price. In the current system, if both
                parties are in the same district/area, it is necessary that both of them go to the nearest
                economic center as they don&#39;t have a platform to communicate with each other. What if they
                have a platform to communicate and reduce the transport cost and make more profits.
                As thoga.lk we try to uplift agro-industry in Sri Lanka and restoring it to the glorious state
                by facilitating and helping the traditional farmer through technology and transforming them
                to much more efficient, modern farmers in the 21​ st ​ century.
